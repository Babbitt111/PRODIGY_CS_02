# 🖼️ Image Encryption Tool – Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 2

This Python tool encrypts and decrypts images using pixel-level manipulation. Developed as part of my **Cyber Security Internship** with **Prodigy InfoTech**, it demonstrates how simple transformations can obscure and restore image data securely.
